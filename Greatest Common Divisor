--PROBLEM--
Write a method that takes 2 parameters and returns the greatest common divisor.

Any number less than 10 should return -1.

Eg. 12 and 30 would return 6, since:
    12 is divisible by 1,2,3,4,6,12     and
    30 is divisible by 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.



--SOLUTION--
public class GreatestCommonDivisor {
    public static int getGreatestCommonDivisor(int first, int second) {
        if(first < 10 || second < 10) {
            return -1;
        }
        while (first != second){
            if (first > second){
                first -= second;
            } else
                second -= first;
        }
        return first;
    }
}
