--PROBLEM--
Write a method that takes 3 parameters: bigCount, smallCount, and goal. The big count is worth 5 kilos, small is worth 1,
and goal is the kilo amount that must be filled.

Return true if the bags can be evenly divided to fulfill goal. There can be leftovers.

Return false if there are negative amounts, there are not enough kilos in big or small bags, or if bags cannot be divided evenly.


--SOLUTION--
public static boolean canPack(int bigCount, int smallCount, int goal) {
        if(bigCount < 0 || smallCount < 0 || goal < 0 || (bigCount * 5) + smallCount < goal) {
            return false;
        }
        while(goal >= 5 && bigCount > 0) {
            goal -= 5;
            bigCount--;
        }
        if(goal <= smallCount) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
